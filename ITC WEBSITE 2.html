            <h2>YHA GOALS</h2>
            <p>The Youth Health Ambassador program was established through the Tobacco-Free Generation movement — a social initiative aimed at reshaping the landscape of teenage smoking and vaping addiction. This movement began after the concept was published and recognized as part of the international Tobacco Control Endgame in 2011. The following year, in 2012, an international education ecosystem was launched to support this vision. Since then, thousands of youths from various countries have joined the cause, aspiring to become a well-informed, Tobacco-Free Generation that refuses to be the "replacement smokers" targeted by the tobacco industry.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>ACCOMPLISHMENT</h2>
            <p>YHA Dinalupihan has accomplished several initiatives such as conducting awareness campaigns in schools, organizing youth seminars about the effects of smoking and vaping, and promoting healthy living through outreach programs. Members serve as role models and peer educators, influencing others to make better choices for their health and future.</p>

                        <p>On September 23, the newly elected Youth Health Ambassadors of Dinalupihan paid a courtesy visit to the local government office, accompanied by SB Member Noli Soriano, MFSK President Aries Atencio, and HEPO Tina Matawaran. These young ambassadors are set to partner with the local government in various projects and programs, particularly those focused on mental health awareness and promoting a Tobacco-Free Generation.</p>

                        <p>During the second week of the Youth Health Ambassador School Campaign for Adolescent Health Awareness, the team visited Luacan National High Schools main campus. The campaign covered topics such as teenage pregnancy, HIV/AIDS, mental health, and the promotion of a tobacco-free generation for seventh-grade students. The program aims to help students take care of themselves and achieve total health by increasing their awareness of these important subjects. Joining the orientation were health workers from the Municipal Health Office and Youth Health Ambassador Mr. Khmer Aquino, a Grade 12 student from the same school. The activity was also supported by the schools principal, Dr. Aida Capili.</p>

            <h2>YHA Chapters</h2>
            <p>In 2024, the Youth Health Ambassador (YHA) Dinalupihan proudly joined the growing YHA family alongside the newly established chapters of YHA Abucay and YHA Orani, adding to the existing YHA Balanga and YHA Mariveles. From the provincial to the local level, these chapters continued to expand the reach and strengthen the impact of the YHA advocacy. As 2024 comes to a close, the organization carries the hope and determination for 2025—a year filled with opportunities, broader outreach, and greater unity. Guided by the mantra "Pinalalawak ang Saklaw, Pinatatatag ang Adbokasiya," YHA aims to establish chapters in the remaining seven municipalities, reaching more youth and communities, and further promoting a healthier, tobacco-free generation.</p>
